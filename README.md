# Godot Commons
This repository serves as a collection of commonly used bits of code used in video games created using the Godot Engine.
The code is split into seperate modules that can be used independently and serve a specific purpose (e.g.  scene transitions).
Each of the modules also contains a README file briefly explaining how to use the module.
